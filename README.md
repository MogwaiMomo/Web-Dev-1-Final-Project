## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 

1) To view this project locally, it needs to run on a web server (aka by opening up http://localhost:8000, etc., not by opening index.html directly through your web browser). Without a web server, your browser will not allow the mp3 to run and the animation won't work.

You can run a built-in web server through Python if you have Python installed on your computer. Simply navigate to the root folder of the project through the command line and type:

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer [press enter]

Alternatively, if running the project on localhost is not an option, you can test a live version of the project on Github.
