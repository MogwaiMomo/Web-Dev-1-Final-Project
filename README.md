## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 

1) To view this project locally, it needs to run on a web server (aka by opening up http://localhost:8000, etc., not by opening index.html directly through your web browser). Without a web server, your browser will not allow the mp3 to run and the animation won't work.

You can run a built-in web server through Python if you have Python installed on your computer. Simply navigate to the root folder of the project through the command line and type:

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer [press enter]

Alternatively, if running the project on localhost is not an option, you can test [the live version of the project on Github](http://mogwaimomo.github.io/Web-Dev-1-Final-Project/).

## PROJECT FEATURES

As requested by my client, this website follows a single-page design, though each section — anchored internally — has been designed to look and behave like a distinct webpage. 

The website is comprised of the following elements:

1. Fixed horizontal navigation bar

2. HTML5 supported video (placeholder video for now)

3. 5 distinct section/pages: 
	i. 		Hero section (above the fold) 
	ii. 	How It Works section 
	iii. 	Feature/Benefit section
	iv. 	Testimonial section
	v. 		Signup Section 

4. The links in the navigation bar and the Signup buttons are enhanced with Jquery top-scroll functionality, so the page scrolls slowly to the anchored section upon click. 

5. The signup form, while not currently functional, uses several HTML5 features, such as email validation & password masking.
